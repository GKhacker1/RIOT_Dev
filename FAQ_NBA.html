<a NAME="magic_number"></a>What is the magic number and how is it computed?</li>

<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px"><br>

The so-called magic number is the smallest number such that any combination of wins by the first-place team and
losses by the second-place team totaling the magic number guarantees that the first-place team will finish the
season with a better record than the second-place team.


<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">The magic number can be computed using the following numbers:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
w<sub>1</sub> - the number of games the team currently in first place has
won so far</li>

<li>
w<sub>2</sub> - the number of games the team currently in second place
has won so far</li>

<li>
g<sub>2</sub> -&nbsp; the number of games the team currently in second
place has left to play</li>
</ul>

<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px"><br>Now, suppose that the first-place team wins x more of its remaining
games and the second-place team loses y more of its remaining games (i.e.,
it wins g<sub>2</sub>-y games).&nbsp; We will now derive a formula for
the magic number, x + y.
<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">The team currently in first place will finish with w<sub>1</sub>+ x
wins and the team currently in second place will finish with w<sub>2 </sub>+
g<sub>2 </sub>- y wins.&nbsp; The team currently in first place will finish
ahead of the team currently in second place as long as w<sub>1 </sub>+
x > w<sub>2 </sub>+ g<sub>2</sub>- y.&nbsp; The magic number is the smallest
number&nbsp; x + y&nbsp; such that x + y > w<sub>2</sub> + g<sub>2</sub>
- w<sub>1</sub>.
<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">Since we are dealing with integers (whole numbers), the magic number is w<sub>2</sub>&nbsp; + g<sub>2</sub> - w<sub>1</sub>+
1.&nbsp;
<p>
Take the Eastern Conference standings on the morning of March 7, 2019 for example.

The first-place team, Milwaukee, has 48 wins and the second-place team, Toronto, has 46 wins and 17 games left to
play.&nbsp; So, w<sub>1</sub>= 48, w<sub>2</sub>= 46 and g<sub>2</sub>= 17, and Milwaukee's magic number is 46 + 17
- 48 + 1 = 16. <p>This means that any combination of wins by Milwaukee and losses by Toronto totaling 16 ensures
that Milwaukee will finish with a better record than Toronto and presumably win the Eastern Conference.&nbsp; For
example, if Milwaukee wins 16 more games, they will finish with at least 64 wins.&nbsp; The best Toronto can do is
46 + 17 = 63 wins.&nbsp; Thus, Milwaukee would finish ahead of Toronto.&nbsp; Likewise, if Toronto were to lose 16
games, they would have 1 game left to play and could finish with at most 47 wins.&nbsp; Since Milwaukee already has
48 wins, they would finish ahead of Toronto in this scenario as well.&nbsp;
<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">
Finally, suppose Milwaukee wins 6 games and Toronto loses 10 - a combination adding up to the magic number,
16.&nbsp; In this scenario, Milwaukee would have 54 wins and Toronto would have 46 wins with 7 games left to
play.&nbsp; This means that Toronto could finish with at most 46 + 7 = 53 wins and could not catch up with
Milwaukee.
<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">

Notice that RIOT lists Milwaukee's first-place clinch number as 15 - one less than the magic number.&nbsp; In this
case, the difference is that first-place clinch number includes the possibility ties for first place while the magic
number does not. Another drawback with the magic number is that it really only applies to a pair of teams. For
instance, if Milwaukee wins 6 more games and Toronto losses 10 games in the example above it does not necessarily
mean that Milwaukee will finish the season in first place. It just means that the Bucks will finish ahead of the
Raptors. Since Indiana has not yet been eliminated, it is still possible that they could move past both Milwaukee
and Toronto. The first-place clinch number, however, is a guarantee; no matter what else happens (except possibly a
tie between three or more teams), the Bucks will clinch first place if they win 15 more games.

<a NAME="playoff"></a>How are the NBA playoff teams determined?&nbsp;</li>

<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px"> The top eight teams in each conference (Eastern and Western) are seeded in a playoff bracket. The winners of the
two conference brackets face off in the NBA Finals. In addition to having the advantage of playing the 8th place
team in the first round, the first-place team in each conference gets home-court advantage throughout the conference
playoffs.

<li><a NAME="ties"></a>What happens when there are ties for playoff spots?</li>

<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">When two teams are tied for a playoff spot then the following
sequence of criteria are applied until the tie is broken:

<ol>
<li> Head-to-head: the team with the better record in the season series between the two teams wins the tie.
<li> Division winner: if one team is a division winner and the other isn't, the division winner wins the tie.
<li> Division record: if the teams are in the same division, the team with the better record against teams in that
division wins the tie.
<li> Conference record: the team with the better record against teams in the conference wins the tie.
<li> Record against conference playoff teams: the team with best record against teams in the conference that qualify
for the playoffs (including teams tied for a playoff spot) wins the tie.
<li> Record against the other conference's playoff teams: the team with best record against teams in the other conference that qualify for the playoffs (including teams tied for a playoff spot) wins the tie.
<li> Point differential: the team with the larger difference between total points scored during the season and
total points
allowed during the season wins the tie.
</ol>
<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">
The process for breaking ties between three or more teams is described at the bottom of the <a href="https://stats.nba.com/standings/">official NBA standings page<a>.
There have only been four times since 2000 that this process has been used and in all of those cases all of the
tied teams went to the playoffs&mdash;the tiebreakers were need solely for seeding in the playoff bracket.
This process can be quite complicated and we are still working on incorporating it in our calculations.



<li>
<a NAME="fpe"></a>If RIOT says that my team's first-place elimination number is zero, does that mean my team has clinched first place?</li>
<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">

Not necessarily. In the example above, the first-place elimination numbers for Milwaukee and Toronto are 0 and 3,
respectively. With 17 games left, Toronto still has a chance to finish in first place. So, Milwaukee hasn't clinched
anything yet.  Having a first-place elimination number of 0 simply means that it's <i>possible</i> for Milwaukee to
finish in first place without winning another game. In other words there is at least one scenario in which no team
in the Eastern East wins more than 48 games.  Based on the current standings and schedule of remaining games,
Milwaukee needs to win at least 15 more games to guarantee a first-place finish. Meanwhile if Toronto doesn't win at
least 3 more games, they can't possibly catch up to Milwaukee. So, they need to win at least 3 more games to avoid
being eliminated from first place.
