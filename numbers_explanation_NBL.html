									<h3>First Place Clinch Number</h3>
									<p>
										The clinch numbers provided by RIOT can be thought of as improved replacements
										for traditional <a href="FAQ_NBL.html">magic numbers</a>. They are superior since they use detailed
										information about teams' remaining schedules in their calculation.

									<h3>Postseason Clinch Number</h3>
									<p>If a team wins this number of additional games, it is guaranteed a postseason berth. This could be as the division winner or as one of the two wild card teams. As with the first place clinch number, an asterisk (*) indicates that even if this team wins all of its remaining games, it cannot guarantee itself a playoff berth.</p>

									<h3>Elimination Numbers</h3>
									<p>The elimination numbers provided by RIOT allow fans to determine whether or not teams have been eliminated from postseason contention, and how close they are to being eliminated.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
									<h3>First Place Elimination Number</h3>
									<p>This is the minimum number of games that this team must win in order to remain in contention for first place in its division. Teams that are already eliminated from first place contention are labeled "Elim" in this box. See the list of frequently asked questions for an example of the distinction between the interpretations of the First Place Elimination Number and the First Place Clinch Number.</p>
