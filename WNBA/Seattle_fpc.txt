First Place Clinch Scenario for Seattle

Seattle's traditional magic number (relative to second-place LasVegas) is 10 + 9 - 11 + 1 = 9.
As shown below, Seattle's first-place clinch number is 8.

If Seattle wins 8 more games, their final win total will be at least 19.
The table below shows the best case scenario for each of the other teams if Seattle wins all 8 of their remaining games.
For each team, the table shows the current record (number of wins (W) and losses (L)) and the number of games that team has
left to play (GL) in the regular season. Taking the schedule of games left to play into account, the 'Losses to Seattle' column gives the
minimum number of games that each team will lose to Seattle if Seattle wins 8 more games. Assuming that each team wins all of its remaining games except for
the games it loses to Seattle, the resulting maximum number of wins and maximum winning percentage are shown in the 'Maximum W' column.

            Team	W	L	GL	Losses to Seattle	Maximum W
        LasVegas	10	3	9	       1 - 0 = 1	18
      LosAngeles	9	3	10	       1 - 0 = 1	18
       Minnesota	9	3	10	       1 - 0 = 1	18
         Chicago	10	4	8	       1 - 0 = 1	17
     Connecticut	6	8	8	               0	14
         Phoenix	6	7	9	       1 - 0 = 1	14
          Dallas	5	8	9	       1 - 0 = 1	13
         Indiana	5	8	9	       1 - 0 = 1	13
      Washington	4	8	10	       1 - 0 = 1	13
         Atlanta	2	11	9	               0	11
         NewYork	1	12	9	               0	10

The table above shows that if Seattle wins 8 more games (19 total), then they will finish the season in first place in the division.

To see that Seattle's first-place clinch number cannot be less than 8, consider the following scenario in which Seattle wins 7 more games (18 total) but does not finish in first place.
