							<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">As the end of the season approaches, baseball fans like to engage in speculation about which teams will advance to the post season and whether their favorite team is still in contention for a playoff berth. Newspapers frequently run headlines in their sports sections declaring that a particular team has been eliminated from contention or that the first place team has clinched a playoff berth. These determinations can often be made by looking at the standings and making a few simple calculations. The RIOT baseball standings can actually tell you when a team has locked up a playoff spot or fallen out of contention days before it is reported anywhere else!

The key is taking into account the actual matchups that remain in the season and enumerating all possible outcomes. Until the final weeks of the season, however, the number of possible outcomes can be astronomically large, which makes such an enumeration impractical even on a very fast computer. By using a powerful and pervasive analytics technique called Network Optimization, it is possible to accurately perform the necessary calculations without explicitly enumerating all possibilities. Consequently, it is possible for RIOT to determine the playoff prospects of a team a few days, or even weeks, before it is reported by the popular media. The following example, using the American League standings on the morning of Wednesday, September 5, 2012 shows how this works.

								Since Baltimore and New York are tied for first place in the AL East with identical records, neither team has a
<a href="FAQ_NBL.html">traditionally calculated magic number</a>. However, if either team wins 26 of their remaining 27 games, they will clinch first place. This is because they still have a four-game series left on the schedule. For example, suppose Baltimore wins 26 more games. That would have to include at least three wins against New York.
The final win totals in this
scenario would be 102 for Baltimore, and at most 100 for New York.  Therefore, RIOT reports that Baltimore has a first place clinch number of 26. Using the same logic, New York's first place clinch number is also 26.

Tampa Bay does not have a traditional magic number because they are not in first place. However, they have a four-game series left with New York, and a six-game series left with Baltimore. If they win all 26 of their remaining games, then they will win the division with 101 wins while New York has at most 99 wins and Baltimore has at most 97. Therefore, RIOT reports that Tampa Bay's first place clinch number is 26.</p>

										It is easy to see from the standings above that Houston is eliminated from first place in the NL Central. If Houston were to win all 32 of their remaining games, they would finish with 72 wins. But, Cincinnati has already won 80 games; so no matter what else happens in the season, Cincinnati will finish ahead of Houston in the NL Central. However, the fact that Houston has also been eliminated from reaching the postseason as a wild card team is not readily apparent from the standings.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">

Since Washington, Atlanta, Cincinnati, and San Francisco already have better records than Houston, their only chance for the playoffs is to clinch the second wild card spot. St. Louis is currently in the lead for that spot with 71 wins. Since Houston still has a chance, however remote, of finishing the season with 72 wins, it looks as though they could still make the postseason as a wild card team. A closer look at the schedule, however, reveals that even a miracle winning streak would not allow Houston to make the playoffs.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">
Los Angeles, who have 70 wins so far, and St. Louis still have a four-game series to play before the end of season. There are no ties in baseball, which means that at least one of these teams will finish with at least 73 wins. If St. Louis wins two or more games in the series, then they will finish the season with at least 73 wins; and if they win one or zero of those games, then Los Angeles will finish with at least 73 wins. Either way, Houston is eliminated from the playoffs because there will be at least five teams in the National League with better records at the end of the season.
									</p>
									<br>
									<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">
Determining that a particular team has been eliminated can often be much more difficult than it is in this example. Follow this link for a more complicated example involving all the teams in the American League East.

									<h3>Optimization Details</h3>
									<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">
										Calculating the clinching and elimination numbers for the RIOT baseball standings involves systematically searching for scenarios in which particular teams finish with or without gaining playoff berths. For example, we determined that San Francisco was eliminated from first place in the National League West on September 8th by proving that no feasible scenario exists in which the Giants win the division. The problem of determining whether a team can advance to playoffs given the current league standings and schedule of remaining games can be solved by a single maximum flow calculation (see Hoffman and Rivlin [1] and Schwartz [2]). By introducing additional constraints, we extend this maximum flow formulation to derive integer linear programming problems which find the minimum number of games a given team must win to clinch a playoff spot or avoid elimination from post season play. Robinson [3] takes a similar approach to finding a scenario which maximizes a given team's lead in the final standings. Interested readers should also consult Gusfield and Martel [4], who show how to find the minimum number of games a team must win to avoid elimination from first place by solving a parametric minimum cut problem.
For more information on the integer programming formulations and implementation of the RIOT baseball standings, send mail to the RIOT Baseball Project and see our paper "Baseball, Optimization and the World Wide Web", which appeared in the March/April 2002 issue Interfaces.
