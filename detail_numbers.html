      <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">
        Clinch Numbers
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:18px;">
        The clinch numbers provided by RIOT can be thought of as improved
        replacements for traditional <a style="color:blue" href="detail_numbers.html">magic numbers</a>. They are superior since they
        use detailed information about teams' remaining schedules in their
        calculation.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">
        First Place Clinch Number
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:18px;">
        The first place clinch number is the most similar to the commonly
        reported magic number. If the team wins this number of additional games,
        it is guaranteed to finish the season with a better record than any of
        the other teams in its division.

        An asterisk (*) indicates that even if this team wins all of its remaining
        games, it will not necessarily clinch first place in its division. In this case
        the team does not have a first place clinch number.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">
        Postseason Clinch Number
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:18px;">
        If a team wins this number of additional games, it is guaranteed a
        postseason berth. This could be as the division winner or as one of the
        two wild card teams. As with the first place clinch number, an
        asterisk (*) indicates that even if this team wins all of its remaining,
        it cannot guarantee itself a playoff berth.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">
        Elimination Numbers
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:18px;">
        The elimination numbers provided by RIOT allow fans to determine
         or not teams have been eliminated from postseason contention, and how
         close they are to being eliminated.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">
        First Place Elimination Number
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:18px;">
        This is the minimum number of games that this team must win in order to
        remain in contention for first place in its division. Teams that are
        already eliminated from first place contention are labeled "Elim" in
        this box. See the <a style="color:blue" href="faq.html">list of frequently asked questions</a>
        for an example of the distinction between the interpretations of the First Place
        Elimination Number and the First Place Clinch Number.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">
        Playoff Elimination Number
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:18px;">
        This is the minimum number of games that this team must win in order to
        remain in contention for a postseason berth, which could be a tiebreaker
        game. Teams that are already eliminated from playoff contention are
        labeled "Elim" in this box.
