							<h3 id="content">Clinch Numbers</h3>
							<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">
								The clinch numbers provided by RIOT Sports can be thought of as improved replacements for traditional <a
								href="FAQ_NBA.html#magic-number">magic numbers</a>. They are superior since they use detailed information about
								teams' remaining schedules and the NBA's procedure for breaking two-team ties in the final standings in their
								calculation.
							</p>
								<div class="row">
								<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
									<h3>First Place Clinch Number</h3>
									<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">
										The first place clinch number is the most similar to the commonly reported magic number.  If the team wins this
										number of additional games, it is guaranteed to finish the season with a better record than any of the other teams
										in its conference, or to win a <a href="FAQ_NBA.html#ties"> two-team tiebreaker</a> for first place in the
										conference.
									</p>
									<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">
										An asterisk (*) indicates that even if this team wins all of its remaining games, it will not necessarily clinch
										first place in its conference. In this case the team does not have a first place clinch number.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
									<h3>Postseason Clinch Number</h3>
									<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">
										If a team wins this number of additional games, it is guaranteed a playoff berth. This could be as the conference
										winner or as one of the other top eight teams
										in the conference</a> (including the possibility of winning a two-way tie-breaker for 8th place).  As with the first
										place clinch number, an asterisk (*) indicates that even if this team wins all of its remaining games, it cannot
										guarantee itself a playoff berth.
									</p>
								</div>
									<!-- Break -->
								<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
									<h3>Elimination Numbers</h3>
									<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">
										The elimination numbers provided by RIOT allow fans to determine whether or
										not teams have been eliminated from playoff contention, and how close they
										are to being eliminated.
									</p>
									</div>
								<div class="4u 12u$(medium)">
									<h3>First Place Elimination Number</h3>
									<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">
									This is the minimum number of games that this team must win in order to
									remain in contention for first place in its conference.  Teams that are
									already eliminated from first place contention are labeled "Elim" in this
									box.
									See the <a href="FAQ_NBA.html#fpe">list of frequently asked questions</a>
									for an example of the distinction between the interpretations of the First Place
									Elimination Number and the First Place Clinch Number.
									</p>
									</div>
								<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<h3>Playoff Elimination Number</h3>
									<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">
										This is the minimum number of games that this team must win in order to remain in contention for a playoff berth. Teams that are already eliminated from playoff contention are labeled "Elim" in this box.
									</p>
									</div>
									<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
										<h3>Caveats</h3>
										<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">
											The <a href="problem_explanation_NBA.html#MIP">method</a> used to calculate the RIOT numbers takes the possibility that the
											team in question could be tied in the standings with one other team, but excludes the possibility of a tie with two
											or more other teams. The elimination numbers are conservative; it's possible that a team can stay in contention with
											fewer wins due to a scenario where they win the tiebreaker with multiple teams. Conversely the clinch numbers are
											technically lower limits on the number of games need to clinch first place or playoff berth.
