						<a NAME="magic_number"></a>What is the magic number and how is it computed?</li>

						<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px"><br>The so-called magic number is usually defined as the smallest number
						such that any combination of wins by the first-place team and losses by
						the second-place team totaling the magic number guarantees that the first-place
						team will win the division.
						<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">The magic number can be computed using the following numbers (see [1]
						for alternative formulae):
						<br>&nbsp;
						<ul>
						<li>
						w<sub>1</sub> - the number of games the team currently in first place has
						won so far</li>

						<li>
						w<sub>2</sub> - the number of games the team currently in second place
						has won so far</li>

						<li>
						g<sub>2</sub> -&nbsp; the number of games the team currently in second
						place has left to play</li>
						</ul>

						<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px"><br>Now, suppose that the first-place team wins x more of its remaining
						games and the second-place team loses y more of its remaining games (i.e.,
						it wins g<sub>2</sub>-y games).&nbsp; We will now derive a formula for
						the magic number, x + y.
						<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">The team currently in first place will finish with w<sub>1</sub>+ x
						wins and the team currently in second place will finish with w<sub>2 </sub>+
						g<sub>2 </sub>- y wins.&nbsp; The team currently in first place will finish
						ahead of the team currently in second place as long as w<sub>1 </sub>+
						x > w<sub>2 </sub>+ g<sub>2</sub>- y.&nbsp; The magic number is the smallest
						number&nbsp; x + y&nbsp; such that x + y > w<sub>2</sub> + g<sub>2</sub>
						- w<sub>1</sub>.
						<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">Since we are dealing with integers (whole numbers), the magic number is w<sub>2</sub>&nbsp; + g<sub>2</sub> - w<sub>1</sub>+
						1.&nbsp;

						<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">The first-place team, Atlanta, has 86 wins and the second-place team,
						Montreal, has 78 wins and 21 games left to play.&nbsp; So, w<sub>1</sub>=
						86, w<sub>2</sub>= 78 and g<sub>2</sub>= 21. Thus, Atlanta's magic number
						is 78 + 21 - 86 + 1 = 14.
						<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">This means that any combination of wins by Atlanta and losses by Montreal
						totaling 14 ensures that Atlanta will win the National League East.&nbsp;
						For example, if Atlanta wins 14 more games, they will finish with at least
						100 wins.&nbsp; The best Montreal can do is 78 + 21 = 99 wins.&nbsp; Thus,
						Atlanta would finish ahead of Montreal.&nbsp; Likewise, if Montreal were
						to lose 14 games, they would have 7 games left to play and could finish with
						at most 78 + 7 = 85 wins.&nbsp; Since Atlanta already has 86 wins, they
						would finish ahead of Montreal in this scenario as well.&nbsp;
						<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">Finally, suppose Atlanta wins 4 games and Montreal loses 10 - a combination
						adding up to the magic number, 14.&nbsp; In this scenario, Atlanta would
						have 90 wins and Montreal would have 78 wins with 11 games left to play.&nbsp;
						This means that Montreal could finish with at most 78 + 11 = 89 wins and
						could not catch up with Atlanta.
						<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">Notice that RIOT lists Atlanta's first-place clinch number as 13 - one
						less than the magic number.&nbsp; In this case, the difference is
						that first-place clinch number includes ties for first place while the
						magic number does not.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first-place clinch number is often
						just one less than the magic number, but sometimes there is a larger difference.&nbsp;

						<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">Here, Los Angeles' magic number is 78 + 19 - 78 + 1 = 20, but the first-place
						clinch number is only 17.&nbsp; What you can't see from the standings is
						that Los Angeles and San Diego will play each other 7 more times before
						the end of season.&nbsp; Thus, if L.A. wins 17 more games, then at least
						3 of them will be against San Diego.&nbsp; Notice that 17 wins for L.A.
						plus 3 losses for San Diego adds up to the magic number, 20.&nbsp; This
						example illustrates how the magic number does not always tell the whole
						story.
						<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">Another drawback with the magic number is that it really only applies
						to a pair of teams.&nbsp; For instance, if San Diego loses 20 of its remaining
						games in the example above it does not necessarily mean that Los Angeles
						will win the division.&nbsp; It just means that L.A. will finish ahead
						of San Diego.&nbsp; Since Colorado has not yet been eliminated, it is still
						possible for the Rockies to win the division.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first-place
						clinch number, however, is a guarantee; no matter what else happens, the
						Dodgers will at least clinch a tie for first place if they win 17 more
						games.
						<li>
						<a NAME="wild-card"></a>How are the wild-card teams determined?&nbsp;</li>

						<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">Each league (American and National) sends five teams to the postseason: the three division winners and two wild card teams.
						The wild card teams are the two teams in the league with the best records among all teams that are not division winners. In princple
						the wild card teams are the teams with the 4th and 5th best records in the league, and are the two best second-place teams. However,
						it's possible that the wild card teams come from the same division, and it's possible that a wild card team could have a better record
						than the division winner of another division.

						<li><a NAME="ties"></a>What happens when there are ties for postseason spots?</li>

						<p style="color:#080808; font-size:18px">This can get quite complicated; see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason">Wikipedia</a>
						or the official <a href="http://m.mlb.com/news/article/59527184/playoff-tiebreaker-rules">Major League Baseball
						web site</a> for details.

						<li>
						<a NAME="fpe"></a>If RIOT says that my team's first-place elimination number is zero, does that mean my team has clinched first place?</li>
						</ol>
						Not necessarily. In the National League East example above, the
						first-place elimination numbers for Atlanta and Montreal are 0 and 8,
						respectively. Notice that Atlanta's record is 86 and 55, and that
						Montreal's is 78 and 63.
						Since
						there more than 20 games left to play, Montreal still has a chance to
						win the division.
						So,
						Atlanta hasn't clinched anything yet.  Having a
						first-place elimination number of 0 simply means that it's
						<i>possible</i> for them to win the division without winning another
						game. In other words there is at least one scenario in which no team
						in the National League East wins more than 86 games.  Based on the current
						standings and schedule of remaining games, Atlanta needs to win at least 13 more
						games to guarantee a first-place finish.
						Meanwhile if Montreal doesn't win at least 8 more
						games, they can't possibly catch up to Atlanta. So, they need to win
						at least 8 more games to avoid being eliminated from first place. This  is
						why their first-place elimination number is 8.
