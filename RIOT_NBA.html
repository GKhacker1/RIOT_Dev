									<h3>Welcome to the RIOT National Basketball Association page!</h3>
									<p>We provide detailed standings for the NBA with new, informative statistics that allow fans to track how well their teams are performing. For each team, we calculate and post the number remaining games that the team must win to
									</p>
									<li>Guarantee (clinch) a first-place finish in its conference</li>
									<li>Guarantee a postseason berth</li>
									<li>Avoid elimination from first place in its conference</li>
									<li>Avoid elimination from the postseason</li>
									<p></p>
									<p>
										These numbers are more informative than magic numbers, since they take into account each team's remaining schedule
										of games and the NBA's two-team tiebreakers <a href="FAQ_NBA.html#ties">(criteria 1-6)</a>. Note that we do not
										consider the possibility of ties between three or more teams in our calculations. However, it appears that <a
										href="problem_explanation_NBA.html#Boston">even the NBA doesn't always consider that possibility</a> when it announces a
										clinch. More details about the <a href="numbers_explanation_NBA.html">numbers</a> and the method of their <a
										href="problem_explanation_NBA.html">calculation</a> are available on this site. Our numbers are updated daily, so be sure to
										return every day to check out who's on the fast track for the postseason, and who's already done for the year.
									</p>

										This project was initially made possible by Professor Dorit S. Hochbaum's</a> ONR research grant N00014-91-J-1241
										and NSF Award DMI-9713482, and was part of the Remote Interactive Optimization Testbed (RIOT) hosted by the <a
										href="https://ieor.berkeley.edu/">Industrial Engineering and Operations Research Department of the University of
										California-Berkeley</a>. The NBA and <a href="baseball.html">MLB</a> standings pages are now hosted by the <a
										href="https://www.smu.edu/Lyle/Departments/EMIS">Department of Engineering Management, Information, and Systems of
										the Bobby B. Lyle School of Engineering at Southern Methodist University</a>. Our models for calculating the NBA
										numbers were updated during the 2018-2019 season to take the two-team tiebreaking rules into account in a
										collaboration with the <a href="https://mechanical.mines.edu">Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Colorado
										School of Mines</a>.
